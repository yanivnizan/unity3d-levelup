===============
Working with Unity Test Tools:
- Install Unity Test Tools from assets store or from https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/13802 
- Use NUnity to create tests (See example to Level class: Soomla/Editor/UnitTest/LevelTest.cs)
- Run tests from Unity GUI: Open Unit Test Tool (menu bar, should be added after adding the asset from step 1), and choose Unit Test Runner. Select the test you wish to execute and press play.
- Run tests from command line by executing run_tests script.
